Weed Tracker V50 Pilot — Cloudflare Upload

1) Put these five files at the ROOT of your project folder:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - apps.js
   - storage.js
   - extras.js

2) Zip the folder (optional if Cloudflare accepts folder upload).

3) Go to Cloudflare Pages → Create Project → "Upload assets" → drag the ZIP (or the folder).
   Build settings: None (static). Framework preset: None.

4) After publish, open the site and do a hard refresh:
   - Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: ⌘ + Shift + R

5) Add to Home Screen on iPhone:
   - Share → Add to Home Screen.

Libraries (weeds/chemicals) are pre-seeded locally; "Clear ALL Local Data" in Settings leaves libraries intact.
